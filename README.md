Symfony Standard Edition with fduch/workflow-bundle on-board
============================================================

This is Symfony Standard Edition (based on Symfony 2.7.19 currently) with [fduch/workflow-bundle](https://github.com/fduch/workflow-bundle) installed.
You can see example how workflow can be configured in [workflow.yml file](https://github.com/fduch/symfony-standard-workflow/blob/master/app/config/workflow.yml).

> Due to BC-breaks introduced in Workflow component and FrameworkBundle inside 3.2-branch (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20462)
> please refer to ([1.x](https://github.com/fduch/workflow-bundle/tree/1.x)) branch of the fduch/workflow-bundle with [symfony/workflow](https://github.com/symfony/workflow) component in old versions up to [cdddaeec794e4096f2f80f0298fc1a4b5bfacb83](https://github.com/symfony/workflow/commit/cdddaeec794e4096f2f80f0298fc1a4b5bfacb83) (non-including) 
> and ([master](https://github.com/fduch/workflow-bundle/tree/1.x)) branch otherwise.
> Current ([master](https://github.com/fduch/symfony-standard-workflow/tree/master)) version uses `master` version of fduch/workflow-bundle
